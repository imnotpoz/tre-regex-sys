tre-regex-sys
-------------
This is a crate that builds [bindgen](https://crates.io/crates/bindgen) bindings for [tre](https://laurikari.net/tre/).

This does **NOT** provide a safe API wrapper! See [tre-regex](https://crates.io/crates/tre-regex) for a safe API wrapper.

For documentation, see the [docs](https://docs.rs/tre-regex-sys) and the [official TRE documentation](https://laurikari.net/tre/documentation/).

Feature flags
=============
The following features are available:

- `approx`: Enable approximate matching functionality (enabled by default)
- `vendored`: Enable vendored build copy of TRE instead of system TRE (enabled by default)
- `wchar`: Enable functions designed to work with `wchar_t` (disabled by default)

Supported versions
==================
At least TRE 0.8.0 should work, but the latest from [git](https://github.com/laurikari/tre) is highly recommended for various fixes; the last release is quite old by this point.
